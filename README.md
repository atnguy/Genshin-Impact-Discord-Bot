# Genshin-Impact-Discord-Bot v1.0.0
A discord bot dedicated to displaying information about character and weapon ascension materials through embeds on Discord.
(also my first time working on a discord bot)
## Files

### .env
Location of where the discord bot's token should be to make the code work. Because I'm locally hosting the bot, if you want to use these features, you'll have to make your own bot and place their token in there.

### genshin.py
Location of the code for the discord bot.

## Features
* Obtain a list of ascension materials for each ascension for the requested character in an embed

## How to use
I don't plan on hosting my bot via a web service and I will use my bot for personal uses. You'll have to create your own discord bot and place your bot's token into the .env file.
